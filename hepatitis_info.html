            <h1 class="head" id="H" >Hepatitis</h1>
            <h2>Hepatitis is a viral infection that causes inflammation of the liver. There are several different types
                of Hepatitis, each caused by a different virus. The most common types of Hepatitis are Hepatitis A,
                Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C.</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="info">
            <h1 class="head" id="A">Hepatitis A</h1>
            <h2>Hepatitis A is a highly contagious virus that is transmitted through contaminated food or water. It is
                typically spread when people consume food or water that has been contaminated by feces from an infected
                person. Symptoms of Hepatitis A include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
                pain, and yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). Most people recover from Hepatitis A
                without treatment, but it can be serious, particularly in older adults or people with other liver
                problems. A vaccine is available to prevent Hepatitis A.</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="info" id="B">
            <h1 class="head">Hepatitis B</h1>
            <h2>Hepatitis B is a serious and potentially life-threatening virus that is transmitted through blood and
                other body fluids. It can be transmitted through sexual contact, sharing needles, or from mother to baby
                during childbirth. Symptoms of Hepatitis B may include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea,
                vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Some people with Hepatitis B may not have any symptoms, but they
                can still transmit the virus to others. Hepatitis B can lead to chronic infection, which can cause
                serious health problems such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and liver cancer. A vaccine is
                available to prevent Hepatitis B.</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="info" id="C">
            <h1 class="head">Hepatitis C</h1>
            <h2>Hepatitis C is a viral infection that is transmitted through contaminated blood. It is a serious and
                potentially life-threatening virus that can lead to chronic infection and cause serious health problems
                such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Many people with Hepatitis C do not have any symptoms, but they can
                still transmit the virus to others. Hepatitis C is treated with antiviral medications, which can cure
                the infection in most cases.</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="info" id="D">
            <h1 class="head">Hepatitis D</h1>
            <h2>Hepatitis D is a virus that can only infect people who are already infected with Hepatitis B. It is
                transmitted through contaminated blood and can cause serious liver damage.</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="info" id="E">
            <h1 class="head">Hepatitis E</h1>
            <h2>Hepatitis E is a virus that is transmitted through contaminated food or water and is most common in
                developing countries. It is typically self-limiting, meaning that it goes away on its own, but it can be
                serious, particularly in pregnant women.</h2>
